# liri-node-app
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface.

The purpose of LIRI is a NODE app designed to retrieve information in the command line.
It's like SIRI, but you type commands instead of talking into your phone.

LIRI can retrieve three types of data: a user's latest 20 tweets, the spotify information
of a song, and the IMDB information from any film. To accomplish this, LIRI
uses NODE packages to access the Twitter and Spotify APIs. It also uses Request,
a NODE package that grabs data from OMDB API.

LIRI was created in 2018 by Jonathan Ridewood. Future iterations could include
different commands.
